# Bike Sharing Pattern Prediction with pytorch

Creating a Linear Deep Learning Model to predict number of bikes on a particular day of the month using historical data.

Overview of the steps:

1. Load and Prepare the Data
2. Build a Linear NN to fit the training data
3. Training the model
4. Set the hyperparameters and pick the best performing model
5. Test the model
